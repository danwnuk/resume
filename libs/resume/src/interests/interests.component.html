  Gaming has always been my biggest passion aside from programming. I started competing when I was a teenager back in the game Unreal Tournament 2004 and became a top player.
  After that I spent time competing on teams in Counter-Strike: Source and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I always strived to become the best I could be - and I like to think I have that
  same mindset when it comes to software development.
